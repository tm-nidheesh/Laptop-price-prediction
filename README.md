# Laptop-price-prediction

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a laptop based on its features, such as processor, RAM, storage capacity, graphics card, screen size,touchscreen, weight and brand. 
The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled laptop data, and evaluated on a separate set of test data to measure its performance.

The first step in the project is to gather a dataset of labeled laptop data, which might include data such as brand, model, processor type and speed, RAM, storage capacity, graphics card, screen size, and price.

THE DATASET USED CONTAINS THE DETAILS OF LAPTOPS AVAILABLE IN INDIA AND THE PRICE PREDICTED IS IN INR.

Next, the dataset needs to be preprocessed to extract useful features that can be used by the machine learning model. 
This might involve cleaning the data, removing missing values, creating new features ,and transforming categorical features into numerical features.

Once the dataset has been preprocessed and the features have been extracted, a machine learning algorithm can be trained on the labeled data. 
There are several regression algorithms that can be used for this task, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector regression, or ensemble techniques.
In this project I have used Random Forest algorithm to predict the prices.

After the model has been trained, it can be evaluated on a separate set of test data to measure its performance. 
Common performance metrics for regression tasks like laptop price prediction include mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared.
I have used R2 score and MSE as performance metric and deployed using Heroku.

This model can be used to predict the price of new laptops based on their features, and the results can be used to inform pricing decisions or market positioning strategies for laptop manufacturers and retailers.
